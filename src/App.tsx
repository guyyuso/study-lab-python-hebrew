Here's the fixed code with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of the file, add these closing brackets:

    ]
  }
];

// The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

The issue was missing closing brackets for the labs array and the last lab object. I've added them at the appropriate place. The rest of the code is correct and complete.

This closes:
1. The last lab object with `}`
2. The labs array with `]`
3. The type declaration with `;`

The code should now be properly balanced and work as expected.
